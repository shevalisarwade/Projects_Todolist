In this we are creating a Todolist
It will have tasks, we'll be able to add, update, list or delete tasks.
we have to basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/ES6. You should also know the fundamentals of React, which you can learn by reading Getting Started with React.
Create React App
We'll start by installing the project with create-react-app.

Create React App is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React.

To create a project, run the following command:

npx create-react-app react-todo-app
Note: npm includes npx tool â€” a package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2+.

Once that finishes, move to the newly created directory and start the project.

cd react-todo-app
npm start

Now, We'll install bootstrap to provide user interface to our app.

now we will create a basic layout with three components as shown in below reference layout:

TodoInput
TodoItem
TodoList

In which we can ADD A NEW TASK
WE CAN CREATE A TSK, ADD TASK, DELETE TASK AND UPDATE TASK.


#Conclusion
WE CRETAE a todo react app which is allowing user to CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE tasks.
